# Windows 11 Upgrade Simulation Using Microsoft Intune

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview
This project simulates an enterprise-scale upgrade of Windows 10 devices to Windows 11 using Microsoft Intune and Endpoint Manager. The goal was to mirror what a company like LA Care Health Plan would perform during a real-world upgrade of 3,900 managed workstations.

Using a Microsoft 365 Business Premium trial, I enrolled a Windows 10 VM into Intune, assigned a Windows Update Ring to upgrade to Windows 11, and applied a compliance policy to enforce enterprise security standards.
