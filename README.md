# Windows 11 Upgrade Simulation Using Microsoft Intune

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview
This project simulates an enterprise-scale upgrade of Windows 10 devices to Windows 11 using Microsoft Intune and Endpoint Manager. The goal was to mirror what a company like LA Care Health Plan would perform during a real-world upgrade of 3,900 managed workstations.

Using a Microsoft 365 Business Premium trial, I enrolled a Windows 10 VM into Intune, assigned a Windows Update Ring to upgrade to Windows 11, and applied a compliance policy to enforce enterprise security standards.

<br>
<b>Allow Microsoft Product Updates</b> - This ensures updates for Microsoft apps like Office, Edge, etc., are delivered along with Windows Updates
<b>Allow Windows driver</b> - Allows Windows Update to install updated hardware drivers <br>
<b> Quality update deferral period & Feature update deferral period</b> - We don't want any delays so I set it to 0.
